fixed the sniper and added webhook

made by h0nda
all i did was fixed getting the x-csrf and added a webhook for successful/failed snipes

make sure you edit the sniper.py file and add in your  webhooks

if it does not work, you need to edit the sniper.py file and put in your full cookie in the headers part near the bottom
